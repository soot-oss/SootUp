/**
 * The top type is a superclass of all other types. This is similar to {@code java.lang.Object} but
 * also includes primitive types. <br>
 * This type can't exist in Java source code, but it can implicitly exist in bytecode. This happens
 * when the compiler re-uses local variables with the same id, but different types.<br>
 * If you see this type when you didn't expect it, you probably need to <b>turn on the {@link
 * LocalSplitter}</b>. The {@link LocalSplitter} will remove all situations where a {@code TopType}
 * could be created by the {@link TypeAssigner} (at least when the bytecode has been generated from
 * Java source code).
